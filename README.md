## Welcome
 Welcome to Age of Nations, an Open-Source 4X turn-based strategy game. As the creator, I was inspired by games like Civilization, Age of Empires, and Rise of Nations. I came up with the title by combining Rise of Nations and Age of Empires to get the name Age of Nations. Although, the gameplay is much like that of Civilization.
